# Todo react with redux

 Last week we built our first end to end React Todo App. This week we will build a similar Todo app but this time we use Redux! In this repo exists a functioning vanilla React Todo app like the one you built before. Our goal is to take this working app and migrate the code base so that all our state is managed by Redux. 

## Step 0
    Clone this repo and get the app to run as is. Notice that the `package.json` has a `npm start` script that runs the `webpack-dev-server`. Don't forget to `npm install`!
